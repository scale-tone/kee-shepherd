# KeeShepherd

This Visual Studio Code extension helps you to take care of credentials (secrets, access keys, connection strings etc.), that are typically spread across numerous config files on your devbox(es).

Instead of trying to catch them with various fuzzy secret detection tools, why not simply put your secrets on a leash?
